Steps to compile and run:
1. The program is written in Java. So if running from stdlinux, the package JDK current needs to be subscribed using ‘subscribe’ command.
2. To run the Makefile to compile the program, the command 'make' should be entered in the directory containing the source(.java) files.
3. The program reads the Input from a file which is specified as an argument to the program. It outputs the simulation to stdout.
4. To execute the program with an input file, the command ‘java Restaurant <path-to-file>’ should be entered.
	For example, for the input 'data1.txt' in the current directory, the command ‘java Restaurant data1.txt’ should be run.
